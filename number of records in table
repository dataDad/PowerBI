 I needed to create a measure that calculated a distinct count on a visual which had several filters applied to it. He showed me the ALLSELECTED function which is quite useful in these situations.

One note from Cory is that ALLSELECTED is a complicated function and we should remember one key rule to know. ALLSELECTED is to only use it in TOP level measures. Never reference a measure that uses ALLSELECTED. Following that should keep you pretty safe.
