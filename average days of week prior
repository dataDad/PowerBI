My date table is called Date with the primary date column also being called 'Date' and the Day of Week (i.e. Mon, Tues, Wed, etc) is called 'Day Of Week'.
[Net Sales] is simply SUM(Sales[SalesAmount])
[Count of Days] is simply COUNT('Date'[Date])
The IF(HASONEVALUE()) is likely redundant but I threw it in there.
Essentially all I do is grab the 8-week date range, filter out to just that day of the week, then divide the sales by the number of days.
At the end of it I could've just used the _RollingWeeks parameter as my denominator but I left the _DayCount in for testing purposes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOW Avg Sales =
var _RollingWeeks = 8
var _CurrentDate = IF(HASONEVALUE('Date'[Date]),SELECTEDVALUE('Date'[Date]), MAX('Date'[Date]))
var _StartDate = _CurrentDate - (_RollingWeeks * 7)
var _DayOfWeek = LOOKUPVALUE('Date'[Day of Week], 'Date'[Date], _CurrentDate)
var _NetSales = CALCULATE([Net Sales]), FILTER(ALL('Date'), 'Date'[Date] > _StartDate && 'Date'[Date] <= _CurrentDate && 'Date'[Day of Week] = _DayOfWeek))
var _DayCount = CALCULATE([Count of Days], FILTER(ALL('Date'), 'Date'[Date] > _StartDate && 'Date'[Date] <= _CurrentDate && 'Date'[Day of Week] = _DayOfWeek))
var _ret = DIVIDE(_NetSales, _DayCount)
RETURN _ret
